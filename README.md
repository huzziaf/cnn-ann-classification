# CIFAR-10 Classification with CNN and ANN

This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the CIFAR-10 dataset classification. The project includes data visualization, model design, hyperparameter tuning, training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

## Steps

### 1. Data Loading and Visualization

- Download and load the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Display a random sample of 10 images from each class.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

### 3. CNN Model Design and Implementation

- Design a CNN model suitable for image classification tasks.
- Implement the CNN model using a deep learning framework.

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning

- Perform hyperparameter tuning to select the optimal values for the model's hyperparameters.

### 5. Model Training and Evaluation

- Train the CNN model using the training dataset.
- Evaluate the model's performance on the validation dataset.

### 6. Results Visualization

- Plot the training and validation loss and accuracy.
- Display the results with the following evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
  - Top-5 Accuracy
- Display the confusion matrix, ROC Curve, and Area Under the Curve (AUC).
